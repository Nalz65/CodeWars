# CodeWars
This is a repository of my Journey on completing coding tasks based on the language I am practicing via codewars

Currently I've been on the lowest level of Kata for python coding. 

I am to put in a lot more work to prove proficiency in coding, based on any language that I am interested in.

Languages will be seperated by folders and may have subfolders based on the rank that I am busy with.
